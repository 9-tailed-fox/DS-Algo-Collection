'''The delete_node_at_pos takes in pos as one of the input parameters.

First of all, we check on line 2 if the linked list is an empty list or not. We only proceed to line 3 if self.head is not None.

As we discussed before, we need to handle the case where pos will equal 0. If pos equals 0, it essentially means that we want to delete the head node.

On line 3, cur_node is initialized to the head node. Next, we check if pos is 0 or not. If it is, we update the head node to the next node of cur_node, set cur_node to None, and return from the method (lines 5-7). On the other hand, if we are deleting a node at a position other than the head node, we will proceed to line 9. We declare prev and set it to None and on line 10, we initialize count to 0. Now we traverse the linked list by updating prev and cur_node (lines 12-13) and increment count by 1 on line 14. The while loop will terminate if cur_node becomes None or count becomes equal to pos which will imply that cur_node will be the node that we want to delete.

The code on lines 16-20 is precisely the same as in the delete_node class method.

I hope everythingâ€™s been clear up until now. You can practice this method more by playing around with it in the coding widget below:'''
